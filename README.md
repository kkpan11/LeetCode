# LeetCode
This is the LeetCode solutions that I implemented.
The file structure is **problem-based** with the specific number on the LeetCode website so that it can be easily found with the **specific number directory**.
There is at least one solution for a specific number folder. At first, I mainly implemented in **C** programming language. And I will add **other language versions** when I get there.
Also it includes my **failed** submitted solutions which reserves my **thinking process**.
